1. Performed ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) operations in Python as part of analysis of the accelerometer sensor data for carrying out gesture recognition of users.  

2. Extracted the sensor data from distinct text files containing information about 20 gestures (each gesture repeated 20 times) performed by each of the 8 users. 

3. Transformed the sensor data extracted from each of 3200 text files by reading each of the x, y, and z coordinates respectively or sequence of movements constituting a gesture as a column-major flattened array. 

4. Compiled the transformed data and loaded it to the csv file for further analysis and classification of gestures.
