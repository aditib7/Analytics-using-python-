1. Segmented FFP (Frequent Flyer Program) customers of an airline by using K-means clustering and assessed optimal number of clusters or K value by elbow plots. 

2. Presented problems in increasing airline's FFP enrollments from customer segmentation in given data by root cause analysis, 
including contributing external factors, insufficient FFP enrollment duration, and absence of airline's rewards criteria details 
to understand the flying behavior of FFP customers. 

3. Identified problems with insufficient information in the dataset pertaining to whether the recently enrolled FFP customers are related to 
the earlier enrolled customers that could result in marketing programs to not serve their intended purpose. 

4. Made an observation that flying behavior of FFP customers could be properly determined when a customer has enrolled for considerable duration 
and has not enrolled for less number of days as given in one of the features in the dataset.  

5. Used 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values in feature with values of enrollment duration in years to create a categorical feature with 
description about year range corresponding to the value given in feature of enrollment duration. 

6. Studied patterns and relations between this categorical feature and other features in the dataset by using cross tables and libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn 
for visualization of data.
