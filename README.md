Assignment 1: Classification of Bad Loans:

A lending institution, Cautious plc is into the business of offering credit to individuals. The lending institution has recently compiled data on its existing customers. The institution wishes to develop a classification model for predicting defaults on scheduled loan payments by its customers. In this project, the aim is to build a model for classification of bad loans to enable the lending institution to take suitable actions when it comes to identifying customers, who are likely to default on their scheduled loan payments and consequently, reduce the loss of revenue.

Please check below the summary of objectives and major findings of this assignment:

1. Analyzed the data of a lending institution to predict the default likelihood on loans by classification into 2 categories - good and bad loans.

2. Identified patterns in the data and relations between the features and the label by studying line plots, histograms, cross tables, correlation, and count plots. Checked the relation between loan amount, loan duration, and instalment rate using plots.

3. Compared the factors considered vital in the existing industry practices versus features in the dataset for classification of bad loans to infer the incompleteness of the given dataset and lack of proper justification for making the claims about default likelihood in the label of dataset.

4. Made important observations about imbalanced misclassification costs attributed to incorrect prediction of bad versus good loans. Also tackled issues such as inconsistent information, high cardinality values, and choice of suitable metric for evaluation of classification.

5. Employed a cost-sensitive learning approach that involved a combination of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to oversample from minority class (bad loans) and ENN (Edited Nearest Neighbors) to undersample from majority class (good loans) for building a classification model. Evaluated the model using F2 score metric for assigning greater weightage to recall or sensitivity than to precision for better prediction of bad loans.
