In this Kaggle assignment, I predicted a continuous target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. 
All of the feature columns, cat0 - cat9 are categorical, and the feature columns cont0 - cont13 are continuous.

My approach in this assignment:

Aced problem on prediction of insurance amount by using mutual information to check dependencies 
and permutation-based feature importance in Random Forest Regressor to rank features and identify overfitting of the model.
