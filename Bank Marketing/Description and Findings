Problem: Classification of outcomes of a bank’s marketing campaign

Analyzed the data of a bank’s marketing campaign with the objective of predicting whether there is a subscription to deposit or not as a consequence of that campaign.  

Findings:

1. Made an important finding that around 64% of the subscribers of deposits, who were contacted in the existing marketing campaign were not contacted in the previous campaign. 
This finding suggests that the purpose of features given in the dataset is defeated as incoherent relation is found between the previous and later marketing campaign. 
If coherent relations were present, they could have allowed for better comparison of the outcomes of two campaigns and study of relative effectiveness of campaigns. 

2. Employed logistic regression algorithm for classification of likely subscribers and non-subscribers of deposits post the marketing campaign. 
Plotted ROC-AUC curve using different classification threshold values to obtain the AUC (area under the curve).
